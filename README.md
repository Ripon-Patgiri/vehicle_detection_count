# Vehicle Detection and Counting Application using OpenCV

## Description

- Application that detects and counts vehicles in an image using OpenCV.
- Transformations like Grayscale, Gaussian Blur, Dilation and Morphology are performed to provide better output.
- Built an Web Front End UI using Streamlit to easily test the output and get results.

## Tools and Frameworks Used

- Python
- OpenCV Python Library
- Haar Cascade Car Classifier
- Streamlit Python Library

## Motivation for this Project

- To learn about OpenCV and some transormation functions.
- To learn streamlit to share and create web apps for machine learning applications.

## Potential Real Life Applications of this Project

- Highway Management
- Parking Management
- Toll Collection
